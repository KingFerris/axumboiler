In this folder structure:

Cargo.toml remains the configuration file for your Rust project, and you'll specify your dependencies here.

src/main.rs serves as the main entry point for your application.

src/routes.rs is the main routes file that directs traffic to specific modules and routes, such as the "protect" routes.

src/protect_routes.rs would contain routes and logic specific to the "protect" section of your application.

Inside src/apis/v1/products/, you have organized the products-related components in a clear and modular way. Each file serves a specific purpose, such as handling requests (product_handler.rs), defining data models (product_model.rs), specifying routes (product_routes.rs), and schema validation (product_schema.rs).

src/db.rs is where you handle database connection and configuration, if your application uses a database.

src/utils.rs holds utility functions and helper code for the backend.

.env can be used for storing environment variables if needed for configuration management.

.gitignore defines files and directories to be ignored by version control systems like Git
